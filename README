# Anime Search App

A React + TypeScript single-page application (SPA) for searching and viewing anime details, built using the [Jikan API](https://docs.api.jikan.moe/).  

---

## Project Overview

This mini-project demonstrates React proficiency by implementing a full-featured **Anime Search App** with:

- Search anime using instant debounced search  
- Filter results by genre and year  
- Sort results by score or popularity (High → Low / Low → High)  
- Pagination of search results  
- Detailed anime page with image, synopsis, episodes, score, genres, type, and airing dates  
- Friendly error handling and loading states  

The project is built with **React 18+, TypeScript, Redux, React Router**, and **Chakra UI** for styling.

How to Use

Type an anime name in the search bar — results update instantly.

Sort by score or popularity, High → Low or Low → High.

Click on an anime card to see detailed information on the Detail Page.

Use the Back button to return to the search page.

Notes

API requests are rate-limited by Jikan, so excessive rapid searching may trigger a 429 error. Retry button appears when this occurs.

Blank search input loads top anime instead of showing empty results.
